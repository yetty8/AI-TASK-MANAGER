# AI Task Manager
*A human-guided task management system with responsible AI assistance*

## Overview
AI Task Manager is a full-stack web application designed to support task organization and prioritization through **AI-assisted suggestions**, while keeping users fully in control of decisions.

The project emphasizes **human-in-the-loop design**, where AI augments planning and clarity rather than replacing user judgment.

---

## Problem Context
Task management tools often overwhelm users with automation that lacks transparency or control.  
This project explores how AI can be used **responsibly and selectively** to support productivity without obscuring intent or decision-making.

---

## Key Features
- Task creation, categorization, and scheduling
- AI-assisted task prioritization and reminders
- Clear separation between AI suggestions and user actions
- Clean, minimal interface focused on usability and clarity

---

## Responsible AI Design
AI features in this application:
- Provide suggestions rather than automatic decisions
- Are optional and user-invoked
- Do not modify or execute tasks without user confirmation

This approach mirrors responsible AI principles used in professional and public-interest contexts.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API
- **Deployment:** Vercel / Railway

## Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates how AI systems can:
- Support users without undermining autonomy
- Remain transparent and interpretable
- Be integrated thoughtfully into real-world workflows

---

## Future Improvements
- Explainable AI summaries for task recommendations
- User feedback loops to refine AI suggestions
- Expanded controls over AI behavior and scope
